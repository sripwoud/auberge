# Only for release-pr: open/update release PR when commits match (excludes docs, chore, refactor, etc).
# Includes feat!/fix! (breaking) and feat(scope):/fix(scope):.
# Does NOT apply to "release-plz release" (publish). Publishing is triggered by merging the release PR
# (release_always / commit associated with a release-plz-* PR), so no loop.
